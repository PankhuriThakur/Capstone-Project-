# Summary of business problem and project objective
The key challenge for Home Credit is to maximize their loan approval process by accurately identifying customers with a high likelihood of repaying their loans on time. This will require developing an efficient and accurate predictive model that can assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers.

# Group's solution to the business problem
Our task was to develop a classification model to predict whether a loan applicant would likely default effectively. The data we were provided consisted of various credit-related information for each application. We cleaned this data by removing outliers, imputing the mean values of columns for missing values, and dummied the categorical variables. Once the final dataset was ready to be tested, we split it into a train and test set. Models were then able to use K-fold cross-validation to train the models. Our team used a total of five classification methods to develop a total of ten models to be tested. In addition, we implemented three sampling methods to address the class imbalance in the data. When comparing the trained models, we determined our three top models by using the area under the curve (AUC) as the performance metric. The final models included two XGboosted models and one linear model of Ridge Regression. The AUC scores of the models ranged from 0.6477 - 0.6843. The final model we created was an ensemble model using the top three models and their specific sampling techniques. The final ensemble model scored the best of the four modes submitted to Kaggle at 0.71609. We recommend that Home Credit use the combined method in future application reviews. It had a 20% increase in performance over the majority response classification. By implementing this model, Home Credit can better predict which applicant would not be suitable to loan money to based on their previous credit history

# Your contribution to the project
I am proud of the valuable contributions I made to our project. My role in the team involved handling data distribution and outlier analysis, and I believe my efforts significantly enhanced the project's overall quality. During the exploratory data analysis phase, I diligently identified and addressed missing values, ensuring our dataset was clean and ready for further analysis.
Additionally, I took the initiative to remove categorical variables with extremely imbalanced responses, which played a crucial role in refining our data and optimizing subsequent analyses. My thorough identification and visualization of outliers through histograms provided key insights that influenced our decision-making process and improved the accuracy of our findings.

# The business value of the solution
The project's classification model development presents several promising business impacts for Home Credit. By utilizing the model to predict loan applicant default likelihood, Home Credit can make more informed and accurate loan decisions, reducing the risk of granting loans to high-risk applicants and improving overall loan portfolio quality. The efficiency of the model enables a streamlined loan approval process, leading to faster loan processing and enhanced customer experience. With better risk assessment, the company can reduce default-related losses, positively impacting its financial health and profitability. Furthermore, the ability to customize loan offerings based on an applicant's creditworthiness provides a competitive advantage and attracts more creditworthy customers. Additionally, the model ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and promotes responsible lending practices. Overall, the project's success demonstrates the potential for continuous improvement and learning, enabling Home Credit to adapt to market changes and maintain the model's effectiveness over time.

# Difficulties that your group encountered along the way
During the course of our project, we encountered a few difficulties that required collaborative efforts to overcome. As someone in the process of learning coding, I faced challenges while attempting to combine the data and implement the random forest model. Fortunately, my group mates were supportive and provided assistance whenever I encountered roadblocks, helping me gain a better understanding of the process.
Additionally, one of our team members, Heber, faced some difficulties in integrating codes and applying the models that each of us had developed. This integration process posed some technical hurdles, and we had to work together to troubleshoot and find solutions.
Despite these challenges, our group's collective efforts and teamwork prevailed, and we were able to overcome the obstacles. Through perseverance and mutual support, we successfully completed the project and achieved our objectives. This experience not only strengthened our technical skills but also fostered a sense of camaraderie within the team. Overall, the project served as a valuable learning experience and highlighted the power of collaboration in achieving success.


# What you learned in the project
In addition to the technical learnings, this project also highlighted the significance of teamwork and qualities of a good leader. Throughout the project, we gained valuable insights into data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and ensemble techniques. Collaborating with our group mates taught us effective communication, mutual support, and coordination in handling technical challenges. We learned to value diverse perspectives, resolve conflicts, and maintain a positive team dynamic while experimenting with different classification algorithms and addressing class imbalance.
Observing effective leadership, we understood the importance of guiding and motivating the team in both technical aspects and team dynamics. A good leader in this project demonstrated the ability to empower members to contribute effectively and foster a culture of continuous learning. They prioritized tasks, encouraged open communication, and ensured the team remained focused on achieving project objectives. Through this experience, we recognized that leadership in a technical project requires not only strong decision-making skills but also the ability to inspire others, recognize individual strengths, and steer the group towards success with a clear vision and supportive guidance.
